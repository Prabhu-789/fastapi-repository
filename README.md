This project is a microservice for managing user registration, login, and user data. It uses FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for database interaction and PostgreSQL for data storage. The service is dockerized to make it easy to deploy and scale.

Features
- User Registration with password hashing
- User Login with JWT authentication
- Token-based authorization for CRUD operations on users
- Token Blacklisting for secure logout
- RESTful API built using FastAPI
- PostgreSQL database for storing user information
- Dockerized for easy deployment

Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.12 (if running locally without Docker)
- PostgreSQL (if running locally without Docker)

Create a .env file in the root of the project to manage environment variables for both services. Hereâ€™s an example of the variables required:

docker-compose up --build
```
2. Verify the Service
Once the containers are up and running, the FastAPI service will be available at:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

Stopping the Service
To stop and remove the containers, use:
```
